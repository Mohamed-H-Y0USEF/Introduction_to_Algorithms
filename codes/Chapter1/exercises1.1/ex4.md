<h4>How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?<h4>
<hr>

<h5>how are they similar</h5>
<ul>
<li>each or them needs to know the shorest way to save time and effort</li>
</ul>

<h5>how are they different</h5>
<p>
<mark>shortest-paht</mark> problem : it is concernde wit h detemining the shortest distance between to specified points,<br>
but <mark>traveling-salesman</mark> problem : it is concerned with  determining a point through which it achieves the<br> 
shortest distance in relation to the rest of the points, and this is what makes the problem mor complicated,
